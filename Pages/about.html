            <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
            <p> I am a Software Engineer who is passionate about technologies and loves creating apps and websites that
                would be easy to navigate and include various
                interactive features. For the past years, I received my Master's degree in Linguistics and was working
                in
                educational and administrative roles which required organizational, financial and customer service
                skills.
                I've always been curious about the way technologies can change people's life for the better and I am
                looking forward to taking part in this innovative field.</p>
